# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the work day. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

This calendar has only 9 hours in it, from 9 am to 5 pm. It doesn't track days. It has 3 columns. The left column is the time of day and is static. The middle column is where the user enters events. The background color of the text area/time block changes color depending on the time of day. The background color is gray for past events, pink for the present and green for the future. The right column are "save event" buttons, also static except they change color slightly if the mouse moves over them.

The events are stored in local storage until 5 pm when time blocks/text areas and local storage are cleared. Between 5 pm and 9 am all the time blocks/text areas will be gray. At 9 am the next morning the first time block/text area will turn pink and the remainder green.

I did not have enough time to test what happens when the hour increments. Are the colors set correctly. I will test on the Monday April 5, 2021.

There are two paragraphs above the grid that are positioned with the jQuery offset function. They are aligned on the left with the time in the first column. I did not have enough time to change the offset as the window is moved. Maybe I'll do that later.

This app uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.

The following figure shows the app when the time is 11 am.
