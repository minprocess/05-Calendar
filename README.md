# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the work day. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

This calendar has only 9 hours in it, from 9 am to 5 pm. It doesn't track days. It has 3 columns. The left column is the time of day and is static. The middle column is where the user enters events. The background color of the text area/time block changes color depending on the time of day. The background color is gray for past events, pink for the present and green for the future. The right column are "save event" buttons, also static except they change color slightly if the mouse moves over them.

The events are stored in local storage until 5 pm when time blocks/text areas and local storage are cleared. Between 5 pm and 9 am all the time blocks/text areas will be gray. At 9 am the next morning the first time block/text area will turn pink and the remainder green.

I did not have enough time to test what happens when the hour increments. Are the colors set correctly when the hour changes? I don't know. I will test on the Monday April 5, 2021.

[Edit on April 5 2021. The homework I submitted Sunday evening (April 4, 2021) had two critical bugs that I fixed the next day. 1. The link to style.css and script.js used the folder name "assets" with lowercase "a' whereas the actual name is "Assets" with uppercase "A". Somehow the web page worked Sunday evening which it should have not worked. I noticed the problem when the page did not work on Monday. So I fixed the folder name in the html. 2. The time displayed on the web page did not update and the colors did not change at the hour change. That was because I used onTimer() in setInterval(onTimer)(, 60000). I changed it to setInterval(onTimer, 60000) and that fixed the problem. Also, I noticed that you can change events in the past and save them. That should be fixed in a future update.]

There are two paragraphs above the grid that are positioned with the jQuery offset function. They are aligned on the left with the time in the first column. I did not have enough time to change the offset as the window is moved. Maybe I'll do that later.

In script.js there is a variable named test that when set to true causes the time to be 11 am. It is useful to test the colors when the time is outside of 9 to 17. For production this variable is set to false, that is, no test and the actual time is used.

This app uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.

The following figure shows the app when the time is 11 am.
